In an effort to better engage the children in the hospital, we set out to bring in a little Halloween spirit through a pumpkin painting event.  Having no budget, the group acquired over 150 pumpkins through donations.  Unfortunately we found out the cancer patients couldn't participate due to the pumpkins possibly carrying infectious agents.  So we painted them with other patients and did a lot ourselves.  We distributed them on the non-oncology floors and brought smiles to many kids' faces!
